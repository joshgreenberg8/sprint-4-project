# sprint-4-project
Repository for my project for Data Science Sprint 4

Chess game data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess?select=games.csv

The app.py app pulls data from the games.csv file using pandas and uses it to build 
some interactive data displays using streamlit and plotly_express.

The app is deployed to Render at https://chess-games-explorer.onrender.com
